  # Vocabularies (Signatures)

  Following Immerman's "Descriptive Complexity", a vocabulary (also called a
  signature) is a tuple of relation symbols with arities, plus constant symbols.
  We represent this finitely: `numRels` relation symbols with arities given by
  `relArity`, and `numConsts` constant symbols.
